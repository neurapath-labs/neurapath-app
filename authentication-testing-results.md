# Authentication Testing Results

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login Route**: `/login` serves a form that POSTs to `?/login`
2. **Authentication Logic**: Located in `src/routes/login/+page.server.ts`
3. **User Storage**: Currently uses hardcoded users in `src/lib/services/user.service.ts`
4. **Session Management**: Uses JWT tokens stored in secure HTTP-only cookies
5. **Protected Routes**: Handled by `src/routes/(authenticated)/+layout.server.ts` which redirects to login if no user is found

### Hardcoded User
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password` (hashed with bcrypt)
- User ID: `1`

### Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token generation and verification
- Secure HTTP-only cookies
- CSRF protection (SvelteKit default)

### Missing Features
- User registration functionality
- Database integration for user storage
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management

## Test Results

### Login Functionality
- **Status**: Partially functional
- **Issues**: Unable to test with curl due to CSRF protection
- **Expected Behavior**: Should authenticate admin user and redirect to home page
- **Cookie Storage**: JWT token should be stored in secure HTTP-only cookie

### Registration Functionality
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Issues**: No registration form or server-side handling
- **Expected Behavior**: Should allow new users to create accounts

## Recommendations

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Implement User Registration**:
   - Add registration form component
   - Create server-side registration handler
   - Add user creation logic to user service
   - Implement proper password hashing for new users

2. **Database Integration**:
   - Replace hardcoded users with database storage
   - Implement user CRUD operations

3. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Add password strength validation
   - Implement account lockout after failed attempts
   - Add email verification for new accounts

### Testing Strategy
1. **Manual Browser Testing** (preferred due to CSRF protection):
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173/
   - Verify redirect to login page
   - Test login with admin credentials
   - Verify access to authenticated areas
   - Test logout functionality

2. **Automated Testing**:
   - Use Playwright or similar browser automation tools
   - Handle CSRF tokens properly in test scripts
   - Test both valid and invalid login scenarios
   - Test registration flow (after implementation)

## Conclusion

The current authentication implementation provides a basic foundation but lacks essential features like user registration. The security measures in place (JWT, secure cookies, CSRF protection) are appropriate for a SvelteKit application. To fully test the registration and login functionality as requested, the registration feature would need to be implemented first.
