      In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and
      use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to
      provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for
      the following purposes:
      * Improve user experience
      * Run and operate the Website and Services
      Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where you are
      located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific
      purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California
      Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the
      performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is
      necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task
      that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing
      is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
      Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by
      opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we
      will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the
      provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter
      into a contract.

      <h3>Disclosure of information</h3>
      Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have
      requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with us, any
      other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Website and Services available to
      you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not
      authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply
      with legal requirements. We may share your Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose
      privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal
      Information. These third parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform their
      designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing
      or other purposes.
      We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to
      comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary
      to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government
      request.

      <h3>Retention of information</h3>
      We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
      resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We
      may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it,
      but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information
      shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right
      to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.

      <h3>Transfer of information</h3>
      Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country
      other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside
      the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or
      more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any
      such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with
      us using the information provided in the contact section.

      You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right to
      do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the
      processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the
      processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is

      information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for

      you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii)
      you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if

      applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your
      consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
      The right to object to processing
      Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested
      in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by
      providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection.

      Any requests to exercise your rights can be directed to the Operator through the contact details provided in this
      document. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests. Your request
      must provide sufficient information that allows us to verify that you are the person you are claiming to be or
      that you are the authorized representative of such person. You must include sufficient details to allow us to
      properly understand the request and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal
      Information unless we first verify your identity or authority to make such a request and confirm that the Personal
      Information relates to you.

      <h3>Privacy of children</h3>
      We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under the age
      of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services. We encourage parents and
      legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their
      children never to provide Personal Information through the Website and Services without their permission. If you
      have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through the

      your Personal Information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your
      behalf).

      <h3>Do Not Track signals</h3>
      Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have
      your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a
      website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who
      use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers
      communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet set up
      to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail
      throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.

      <h3>Links to other resources</h3>
      The Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware
      that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you
      to be aware when you leave the Website and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource
      that may collect Personal Information.

      <h3>Information security</h3>
      We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
      unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
      in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in
      its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.
      Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and
      privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any
      and all information and data exchanged between you and the Website and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii)
      any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.

      <h3>Data breach</h3>
      In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been compromised or users Personal
      Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not
      limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including,
      but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement
      authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we
      believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise
      required by law. When we do, we will post a notice on the Website.

      <h3>Changes and amendments</h3>
      We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the Website and Services from time to time in
      our discretion and will notify you of any material changes to the way in which we treat Personal Information. When
      we do, we will post a notification on the main page of the Website. We may also provide notice to you in other
      ways in our discretion, such as through contact information you have provided. Any updated version of this Policy
      will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued
      use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at
      that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your
      Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information
      was collected.

      <h3>Acceptance of this policy</h3>
      You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and using
      the Website and Services you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this
      Policy, you are not authorized to access or use the Website and Services.
